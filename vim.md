# Install

```
$ apt-get install vim

$ brew install macvim --override-system-vim && brew linkapps

C:\> chocolatey install vim
```

By default, Ubuntu uses the `vim.tiny`, which lacks support for arrow key navigation. Use `apt-get install vim` to upgrade to full `vim` with arrow key support.

# Configure

```
$HOME/.vimrc

%HOME%/_vimrc
```

# Basic Commands

## Modes

### Normal

By default, Vim begins in Normal mode, for entering commands. To issue a command, type `Colon`, then the command, then `Enter`. This is represented in Vim documentation with the notation `:command`.

### Insert

From Normal mode, press `i` to switch to Insert mode. Then begin typing text.

To return to Normal mode, press `ESC`.

### Visual

From Normal mode, press `v` to switch to Visual mode. This also allows highlighting text by moving the cursor.

To return to Normal mode, press `ESC`.

# Fix common problems

Vim doesn't have the most intuitive defaults. Here are some snippets you can insert into your `$HOME/.vimrc` / `$HOME/_vimrc` in order to fix common problems.

## Delete (backspace) broken in insert mode in Mac OS X

`set backspace=2`

Or use MacVim

## Lack of line numbers

`set number`

## Lack of syntax highlighting

`syntax on`

## Code folding too deep

```
set foldmethod=syntax
set foldcolumn=1
set foldlevelstart=20
```

## Enable Byte Order Marker (BOM)

```
set bomb
```

# Other repositories

* Vim Scripts http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php

# Alternatives

* [vi](http://thomer.com/vi/vi.html) is a precursor to Vim, often installed by default on Unix systems like busybox.
* [Nano](https://github.com/mcandre/cheatsheets/blob/master/nano.md) has a much easier learning curve than Vim.
* [Emacs](https://github.com/mcandre/cheatsheets/blob/master/emacs.md) is comparable to Vim in power, and operates as if in insert mode all of the time.
